# Piqular

**Piqular** is an app that allows you to create beautiful photo websites within a few minutes right from your cell phone. It was born at [HackPrinceton](http://hackprincetons2014.challengepost.com/submissions/22144-piqular) after a spring break trip to Costa Rica and the motivation to work with the dropbox API. Project website: http://swifflet.com/piqular/

## Usage

Piqular requires a Dropbox account with a Public/ folder (newer accounts don't have it anymore).
Set up your Android dev environment in Eclipse and import the project.

To fix the compatibility issues, you additionally need to import appcompat-v7. Go to Import -> Import Existing Android Project. Go to your android SDK directory and select extras/android/support/v7/appcompat as the project. Finish the project import. You should have another project android-support-v7-appcompat now.

Now go to Project Properties -> Android and and add android-support-v7-appcompat as a Library ("is Library" doesn't have to be checked). You might have to delete existing broken references.

I'm not sure why Eclipse now always creates these compatibility issues with Android projects, but hopefully you were able to fix them.

Let me know if there are any other issues.
