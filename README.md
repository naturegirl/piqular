# Piqular

**Piqular** is an app that allows you to create beautiful photo websites within a few minutes right from your cell phone. It was born at [HackPrinceton](http://hackprincetons2014.challengepost.com/submissions/22144-piqular) after a spring break trip to Costa Rica and the motivation to work with the dropbox API.
